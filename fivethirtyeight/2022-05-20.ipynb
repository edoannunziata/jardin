From there, he randomly chooses between crawling in the radial or tangential directions, with a 50 percent chance of each.

When he crawls tangentially, he moves another inch in one of the two directions perpendicular to the radial direction.

One of the most striking things about the image is how clearly we can make out the black hole’s shadow (as shown below). That’s because the plane of its accretion disk is nearly perpendicular to the vector between us and the black hole.\n",
