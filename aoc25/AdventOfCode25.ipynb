    "An extremely interesting problem for day 2!\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the problem gives us a list of pairs of numbers $L = ((a_0, b_0), (a_1, b_1), \\dots)$ and asks us to find the sum of all numbers in each range that are the result of the concatenation of certain number of \"blocks\" of (at least two) repeating digits. Those are _invalid ids_.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, $121212$ would be invalid, because it contains the block $12$ three times. In the first part of the problem, only numbers made of exactly two of those blocks are taken into account, and in the second part the restriction is lifted. We'll analyze the second part as it's a straightforward extension of the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $N$ be a number of $\\delta_N$ digits. $N$ is invalid as per the definition above if and only if for some $k$, with $k | \\delta_N$, it can be written as the concatenation of $\\delta_N / k$ blocks of $k$ digits each.\n",
    "Let this block be composed by digits $c_1 c_2 \\dots c_k$, where juxtaposition denotes concatenation in base 10 representation.\n",
    "This would mean that $N$ could be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N = c_1 c_2 \\dots c_k \\dots c_1 c_2 \\dots c_k \\dots \\dots c_1 c_2 \\dots c_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the block $c_1 c_2 \\dots c_k$ is repeated $\\delta_N / k$ times. But this means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N = c_1 c_2 \\dots c_k \\frac{10^{\\delta_N} - 1}{10^k - 1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, $N$ is a multiple of a \"magic number\"\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu(\\delta_N, k) = \\frac{10^{\\delta_N} - 1}{10^k - 1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second observation is that it's easy to sum the multiples of $n$ from $a$ to $b$, with $a \\le b$.\n",
    "The least of such multiples is $\\left \\lceil a / n \\right \\rceil$ and the greatest of them is $\\left \\lfloor b / n \\right \\rfloor$, therefore\n",
    "they form an arithmetic progression of known length and difference:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for a fixed number of digits $\\delta_N$ and for whatever interval $\\left(a_i, b_i \\right)$, if $a_i$ and $b_i$ have the same number of digits, we have an efficient algorithm to find all invalid numbers, as follows:\n",

    "- For each of them, find the sum of all multiples of $\\mu(\\delta_N, k)$ ranging from $a_i$ to $b_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be tempting to say that we're done, but there's a minor problem. Numbers that are multiples of _both_ $\\mu(\\delta_N, k_1)$ and $\\mu(\\delta_N, k_2)$ for\n",

    "$\\delta_N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, there's a second minor problem: $a_i$ and $b_i$ could have a different number of digits. But this is easily solved: we can \"split\" our interval in\n",
    "two subintervals each of which only contains numbers with the same number of digits. For example, we can solve the problem separately for $(80, 99)$ and\n",
    "$(100, 110)$ and combine the results to obtain the final result for the interval $(80, 110)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is very efficient and terminates instantly on normal hardware. It's interesting to analyze its theoretical complexity. Because we can cache intermediate results, it becomes difficult to give a straightforward analysis on a complex case, as it would require making assumptions on the distribution of input intervals.

    "In other words, $10^{n-1} \\le a \\lt 10^n$, $10^{m-1} \\le b \\lt 10^m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll split the interval in $n-m$ subintervals as per our trick, each representing a different number of digits.\n",
    "For the subinterval that represents $h$ digits, we'll have to perform a number of operations that's proportional to... $2^{d(h)}$ where $d(h)$ is the number of\n",
    "divisors of $h$. This is because inclusion-exclusion effectively requires iterating on the powerset:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{d(h)} \\binom{d(h)}{i} = 2^{d(h)}-1\n",

    "Easy problem but interesting idea. For the problem to have a finite solution, the graph must be acyclic, which makes both parts trivial. (This is not stated as an hypothesis in the problem statement, though. I assume it's an omission?). Technically, we could even slightly relax the acyclic condition: it's sufficient for the graph not to have any cycles on any path from the starting node to the ending node. This would make the implementation slightly more complicated, but it would still be a linear time algorithm: cycles can be detected easily enough keeping some extra information while performing the DFS.\n",

There is a linear time algorithm to compute how many paths go from $S$ to $F$, passing from each of the $I_h$ in any order. This is because if $G$ is acyclic, then there is only one order in which the intermediate nodes can be reached, the same order they appear in a topological sort of $G$."
