    "# Advent of Code 2023 Day 8 - Bonus Round\n",
    "\n",
    "December 8 is a holiday in Catholic Italy -- the Immaculate Conception if you're wondering -- and I'm in bed with a nasty fever. What better occasion to do some Advent of Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "The text of the problem is this: [Day 8 - Haunted Wasteland](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8). The interesting part is the second one. A summary of the problem statement is as follows. You are given as input a directed graph whose edges are labeled with at most two labels, $G = (V, E, L)$ with $L: E \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$. From each node departs exactly one edge for each type of label, and no two out-edges from the same node have the same label. A subset of the nodes $S \\subseteq V$ are starting nodes, and a subset of the nodes $A \\subseteq V$ are accepting nodes. You are furthermore given a finite string $l \\in \\{0, 1\\}^*$. Let $l^*$ be the concatenation of infinitely many copies of $l$.\n",
    "For each node $s$, let $f^n(s)$ be the node reached taking the edge from $s$ labeled with the first character of $l^*$, then the edge outgoing from that node labeled with the second character of $l^*$ and so on for a total of $n$ steps.\n",
    "More formally, let $f^0(s) = s$ and $f^{n+1}(s)$ be the unique $s'$ such that $(f^n(s), s') \\in E$ and $F((f^n(s), s')) = l^*[n+1]$.\n",
    "Determine the least $n$ such that for all $s \\in S$ it holds that $f^n(s) \\in A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more intuitive terms, imagine placing a token on each starting node, and for each character of $l^*$ in order, moving simultaneously each token to the node pointed by the edge labeled with that character. The problem asks after how many moves all tokens will be on accepting nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is interesting but _I dislike problem statements that don't tell you the hypotheses, all of them and all at once_. As we will see, the intended solutions uses the fact that the input is more constrained that what the problem text describes. So, here comes the _bonus round_. Let's try to solve the problem in full generality!\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial observation is this: imagine following the transitions from a certain state. They must eventually cycle, with an optional anticycle. To efficiently find the length of the anticycle and cycle, construct a \"long pointer\" from each state to the state it would reach following all edges of the input string, in order. This may be made efficient by computing them on demand and storing the results to avoid computing anything twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The anticycle and cycle from each node on the \"long pointer\" graph induce an anticycle and cycle in the original state machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point the problem becomes number theory. Let $l$ be the length of the given string, $a$ and $c$ be the lengths of the anticycle and cycle on the long pointer graph respectively, $f(s)$ be node connected to $s$ in the long pointer graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, let $R(s)$ be the set containing all indices $i$ for which following $i$ transitions from $s$ in the original graph (using the prefix of the given string to choose labels) reaches an accepting state.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this notation, it is easy to see that starting from a node $s$, we will be in an accepting state if and only if the number of steps made is in the following set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_s =\n",
    "\\left(\n",
    "\\bigcup_{i=0}^{a} \\{li + j: j \\in R(f^{i}(s)) \\}\n",
    "\\right)\n",
    "\\cup\n",
    "\\left(\n",
    "\\bigcup_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\{la + li + j: j \\in R(f^{a}(s)) \\}\n",
    "\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The final answer is thus the intersection of $X_s$ for all $s$ that are starting states."
